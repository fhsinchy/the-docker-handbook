# Conclusion

I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the time you've spent reading this book. I hope you've enjoyed it and have learned all the essentials of Docker.

Apart from this one, I've written full-length handbooks on other complicated topics available for free on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/farhanhasin/).

These handbooks are part of my mission to simplify hard to understand technologies for everyone. Each of these handbooks takes a lot of time and effort to write.

If you've enjoyed my writing and want to keep me motivated, consider leaving starts on [GitHub](https://github.com/fhsinchy/) and endorse me for relevant skills on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhanhasin/). I also accept sponsorship so you may consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/farhanhasin) if you want to.

I'm always open to suggestions and discussions on a [number of platforms](https://linktr.ee/farhanhasin). Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frhnhsin) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhanhasin/) and hit me with direct messages.

In the end, consider sharing the resources with others, because

> Sharing knowledge is the most fundamental act of friendship. Because it is a way you can give something without loosing something. â€” Richard Stallman

Till the next one, stay safe and keep learning.
