# Registries

Registries are storage for Docker images. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the default public registry for storing images.

Whenever we execute commands like `docker run` or `docker pull` the daemon usually fetches images from the hub. Anyone can upload images to the hub using `docker push` command. You can go to the hub and search for images like any other website.

If you create an account, you'll be able to upload custom images as well. Images that I've uploaded are available for everyone at [https://hub.docker.com/u/fhsinchy](https://hub.docker.com/u/fhsinchy) page.
